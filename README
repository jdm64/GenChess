== Requirements ==

* C++11 compiler
* make
* git
* cppcheck (optional)
* scan-build (optional)

PyQt GUI (deprecated)
* Qt 4.0+ libraries
* PyQt 4.0+ python modules
* Python 2.5+

== Build Instructions ==

A make file is included to build the program. To build, just run the following
command in the same directory as the source.

	make

To clean the build environment just run

	make clean

To modify how deep the AI searches for moves modify the line:

	 maxNg = 5;

In the Engine.h file. On my 2.2Ghz computer, depth 5 takes less than 6 seconds a move

== Running The Game ==

The above build instructions will create a binary called "genchess"
in the build directory. Running the program consists entering the following
command in the build directory.

	./genchess

There are several command line arguments. The default options are for
human vs human and terminal mode.

-i		puts the engine interactive mode, the board and prompt are printed
-g		play genesis chess
-r		play regular chess
-w[c|h]		selects type of white player: c=computer, h=human
-b[c|h]		selects type of black player
-p #		runs the perft command to depth # on the starting position
-v		displays version information
-h		prints the help screen for program and argument info


Also available is the PyQt version. This is started with:

	python qtGenchess.py

To set what players are human or computer edit the line
in the qtGenchess.py file as described

	player = ["human", "computer"]


== Game Rules ==

The game rules are explaned in "Rules.txt" and in the Project Summary.
